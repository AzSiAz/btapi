Welcome to the new **REST API**
centre. I'm planning to cleanup the current API provided by mediawiki 
so that there would be a unified API for accessing Baka Tsuki data.

The API is aiming for full coverage of the listed novels (as of 2015/10/1). 

###Version History

1. 2015/10/1 : Version 1.0 is released.
