Though he had no interest whatsoever in participating in any clubs upon entering Kamiyama High School, he was commanded by his older sister, Tomoe, to join the club she was once a part of, the Classics Club, as it was in danger of being abolished due to its nonexistent member count. Together with his old friends Fukube Satoshi and Ibara Mayaka, as well as with the elegantly ladylike and curiously inquisitive Chitanda Eru, the newly reformed Classics Club ends up finding themselves involved in all sorts of mystery-solving escapades. Houtarou quickly learns that life in the Classics Club, just as Tomoe had promised, would be an interesting one indeed.\nAnd so begins the \"Classics Club Series\".\nAdapted into an anime series by Kyoto Animation in 2012 under the title \"Hyouka\".\n","cover":"https://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/thumb.php?f=Hyouka_v01_000.jpg&width=300","one_off":false,"illustrator":""};
